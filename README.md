A quick example to serve as a reminder to myself on how to get StructureMap up
and running in a basic console application.

Default naming convention allows implicit registration between interfaces and
concrete classes following interface I[name] convention: shown in the
ICalculator and Calculator example.

If the convention is not followed, explicit registration is needed: shown in
the ILogger and ApplicationLogger example.
